# 🌐 Elzero Web School: HTML & CSS Study Repo

This repository tracks my progress through the **HTML** and **CSS** courses provided by **Osama Elzero**. It’s designed as a hands-on lab to master the foundations of web development.

## 🗂 Navigation & Usage

To explore the lessons, start with the main hub:

* **Entry Point:** Open index.html
* **Deep Links:** I've used **anchor tags** within the index to point directly to specific lessons and milestones.
* **Best Experience:** Use the **Live Server** extension in VS Code. Simply click the **"Go Live"** button in your status bar to view the project with automatic browser refreshing.

## 📖 Learning Strategy

To get the most out of these resources, I follow a two-step approach:

1. **Watch the Videos (Preferred):** Code is just syntax; the logic is in the explanation. Watching the official [Elzero Web School](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.youtube.com/c/ElzeroWebSchool) videos is the best way to understand the "why" behind the tags and properties.
2. **Solve Assignments:** Practice makes permanent. I highly encourage you to **solve the assignments yourself** before looking at any external solutions.

## 🚀 Optimization Tips

If you are viewing this locally:

* **Install:** "Live Server" by Ritwick Dey in the VS Code Marketplace.
* **Run:** Right-click `index.html` → **Open with Live Server**.
* **Why?** It prevents pathing errors and saves you from manually hitting the refresh button every time you change a line of code.
